# bikesharing

## Overview
This project is to convince the investors for the bike-sharing program is indeed a potential solid business in Des Moines. For the proposal, we create visualizations of the analysis for NYC CitiBike data through Tableau to show the following: 

- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Top locations of all riders.
